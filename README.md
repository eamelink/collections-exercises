Exercises for Scala Collections
===

This is a set of exercises focussing on the Scala collections in the standard library. It's organized in parts, and each part consists of the skeleton of the exercises with descriptions in the main source directory, and an accompanying tests file in the tests directory.

The goal is to make all the tests pass by adding code to the main source files.

Getting Started
---
* Start sbt 
* run `~ test-only *Part01*`, and observe the failing tests
* Open `src/main/scala/com/lunatech/exercises/collections/Part01.scala` in an editor or IDE, start reading the doc comments from the top and follow along, doing the exercises. Observe that more tests will pass after each succesfully finished exercise.

If you're unsure why a test fails or think the description of an exercise is unclear, you can also look at the test sources.
